# Completed Personal Projects‚úçÔ∏è

- Linear Algebra C++ Static Library
  - Developed a C++ static library with over 80 public methods for easy integration of linear algebra computations, using technologies such as Microsoft CppUnitTestFramework, Visual Studio 2022, and Git/GitHub, while emphasizing robust unit testing, efficient algorithm design, and runtime optimization.
- ATM Bank Application
  - Developed a desktop application using Java and the Java Swing GUI library, enabling users to perform transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers, view transaction history, and save/load data, while emphasizing inheritance, exception handling, and test-driven development with JUnit5. Utilized UML class diagrams and user specifications for effective software development planning and employed JSON for data persistence.
- Sorting Algorthims Visualizer
  - Developed a sorting algorithm visualizer using Raylib C++ Library, allowing users to compare the time it takes to sort around 50 bars using Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort simultaneously. Implemented multithreading to ensure all algorithms are displayed and compared at the same time. Aimed to create a useful tool for visualizing and understanding the differences and time comparisons between these common sorting algorithms.
- Multithreaded Text Analysis
  - Implemented a multithreaded project in C++ using Visual Studio 2022 and Git/GitHub, utilizing a map data structure to efficiently compute word count, average word length, longest word, shortest word, most common word, and the number of unique words while reading large text files. This project aimed to enhance proficiency in multithreading and handling large datasets.

# Completed Projects‚úçÔ∏è

- Linear Algebra C++ Static Library
  - Developed a C++ static library with over 80 public methods for easy integration of linear algebra computations, using technologies such as Microsoft CppUnitTestFramework, Visual Studio 2022, and Git/GitHub, while emphasizing robust unit testing, efficient algorithm design, and runtime optimization.
- Multithreaded Text Analysis
  - Implemented a multithreaded mini project in C++ using Visual Studio 2022 and Git/GitHub, utilizing a map data structure to efficiently compute word count, average word length, longest word, shortest word, most common word, and the number of unique words while reading large text files. This project aimed to enhance proficiency in multithreading and handling large datasets.
- ATM Bank Application
  - Developed a desktop application using Java and the Java Swing GUI library, enabling users to perform transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers, view transaction history, and save/load data, while emphasizing inheritance, exception handling, and test-driven development with JUnit5. Utilized UML class diagrams and user specifications for effective software development planning and employed JSON for data persistence.

# Current Projectsüìã

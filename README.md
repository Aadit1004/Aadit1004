# Completed Game Development ProjectsüéÆ

- ### 3D Multiplayer Chess (June 2023 - July 2023)
  - In my first internship, I successfully solo developed a 3D multiplayer chess game, utilizing Unity, C#, Photon PUN 2, and Visual Studio 2022, with Git/GitHub for version control. I skillfully navigated through the entire game development process, from gameplay programming to UI design. Some key focuses were matchmaking for public matches,  online game synchronization, and optimization for mobile platforms. Post rigorous testing, the game was successfully launched on both the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/super-chess-3d/id6452748872?platform=iphone) and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giro.superchess), marking a significant milestone in my journey of learning comprehensive game development from scratch to production.

# Completed Non-Game Development Projects‚úçÔ∏è

- ### Linear Algebra C++ Static Library (May 2023)
  - Developed a C++ static library with over 80 public methods for easy integration of linear algebra computations, using technologies such as Microsoft CppUnitTestFramework, Visual Studio 2022, and Git/GitHub, while emphasizing robust unit testing, efficient algorithm design, and runtime optimization.
- ### ATM Bank Application (September 2022 - November 2022)
  - Developed a desktop application using Java and the Java Swing GUI library, enabling users to perform transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers, view transaction history, and save/load data, while emphasizing inheritance, exception handling, and test-driven development with JUnit5. Utilized UML class diagrams and user specifications for effective software development planning and employed JSON for data persistence.

# Current Projects🛠️
- ### After Hours (December 2023 - )
  - Currently working on a new first person horror walking simulator in Unreal Engine 5. My main goal is to learn UE5 blueprinting and focusing on user interaction, collisons and triggers, and core game mechanics. 
- ### InsightUBC (January 2024 - )
  - Currently working on a full stack project, along with [Bryan Hui](https://github.com/Sudo-BryanH), which focuses on creating an efficient backend for managing and querying historical data about UBC sections and rooms, followed by developing a user-friendly frontend for interactive queries. Using TypeScript, Node.JS, and Mocha/Chai for testing.
- ### Predictive Model for Air Accident Risk (January 2024 - )
  - Currently working on a supervised learning model that predicts the likelihood of an air accident based on input features based on the NTSB aviation accident data from 1982 to 2024.
# Completed Solo-Development Game Projects🎮
- ### Silent Stalker of Level 0 (July 2023 - August 2023) - [Itch.io Game Page](https://skyl1ne0.itch.io/silent-stalker-of-level-0)
  - During my first internship, I developed a first-person horror game set in the Backrooms' Level 0. Inspired by Slender, players navigate a maze collecting research notes while evading an entity that relies on sound cues. The project emphasized graphics and post-processing to achieve an eerie, liminal aesthetic. I delved deep into NavMesh pathfinding for the AI monster and used Unity's timeline for the death animation. The game was created using Unity, Visual Studio 2022, and managed with Git/GitHub.
- ### Void Rocks (August 2023) - [Itch.io Game Page](https://skyl1ne0.itch.io/void-rocks) - [Source Code](https://github.com/Aadit1004/Void-Rocks)
- ### 3D Multiplayer Chess (June 2023 - July 2023) - [Itch.io Game Page](https://skyl1ne0.itch.io/chess-3d)
  - In my first internship, I successfully solo developed a 3D multiplayer chess game, utilizing Unity, C#, Photon PUN 2, Audacity Audio Editor, and Visual Studio 2022, with Git/GitHub for version control. I skillfully navigated through the entire game development process, from gameplay programming to UI design. Some key focuses were matchmaking for public matches,  online game synchronization, and optimization for mobile platforms. Post rigorous testing, the game was successfully launched on both the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/super-chess-3d/id6452748872?platform=iphone) and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giro.superchess), marking a significant milestone in my journey of learning comprehensive game development from scratch to production.

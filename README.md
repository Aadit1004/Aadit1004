# Current Projects🛠️
- ### After Hours (December 2023 - )
  - Currently working on a new first person horror walking simulator in Unreal Engine 5. My main goal is to learn UE5 blueprinting and focusing on user interaction, collisons and triggers, and core game mechanics. 
- ### InsightUBC (January 2024 - )
  - Currently working on a full stack project, along with [Bryan Hui](https://github.com/Sudo-BryanH), which focuses on creating an efficient backend for managing and querying historical data about UBC sections and rooms, followed by developing a user-friendly frontend for interactive queries. Using TypeScript, Node.JS, and Mocha/Chai for testing.

# Completed Solo-Development Game ProjectsüéÆ
- ### Silent Stalker of Level 0 (July 2023 - August 2023) - [Itch.io Game Page](https://skyl1ne0.itch.io/silent-stalker-of-level-0)
  - During my first internship, I developed a first-person horror game set in the Backrooms' Level 0. Inspired by Slender, players navigate a maze collecting research notes while evading an entity that relies on sound cues. The project emphasized graphics and post-processing to achieve an eerie, liminal aesthetic. I delved deep into NavMesh pathfinding for the AI monster and used Unity's timeline for the death animation. The game was created using Unity, Visual Studio 2022, and managed with Git/GitHub.
- ### Void Rocks (August 2023) - [Itch.io Game Page](https://skyl1ne0.itch.io/void-rocks)
  - Inspired by Atari's "Asteroids," I built a 2D pixel-art space shooter in Unity using C#. While working on it, I learned a lot about collisions, triggers, and game physics, especially when creating gravitational effects and spaceship movements. I also experimented in particle systems for better visual effects for explosions. On the art side, I tried my hand at pixel art with Piskel, giving the game objects its unique look. The coding was done in Visual Studio 2022, with Git/GitHub for version control.
- ### 3D Multiplayer Chess (June 2023 - July 2023) - [Itch.io Game Page](https://skyl1ne0.itch.io/chess-3d)
  - In my first internship, I successfully solo developed a 3D multiplayer chess game, utilizing Unity, C#, Photon PUN 2, Audacity Audio Editor, and Visual Studio 2022, with Git/GitHub for version control. I skillfully navigated through the entire game development process, from gameplay programming to UI design. Some key focuses were matchmaking for public matches,  online game synchronization, and optimization for mobile platforms. Post rigorous testing, the game was successfully launched on both the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/super-chess-3d/id6452748872?platform=iphone) and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giro.superchess), marking a significant milestone in my journey of learning comprehensive game development from scratch to production.

# Completed Non-Game Development Projects‚úçÔ∏è

- ### Linear Algebra C++ Static Library (May 2023)
  - Developed a C++ static library with over 80 public methods for easy integration of linear algebra computations, using technologies such as Microsoft CppUnitTestFramework, Visual Studio 2022, and Git/GitHub, while emphasizing robust unit testing, efficient algorithm design, and runtime optimization.
- ### ATM Bank Application (September 2022 - November 2022)
  - Developed a desktop application using Java and the Java Swing GUI library, enabling users to perform transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers, view transaction history, and save/load data, while emphasizing inheritance, exception handling, and test-driven development with JUnit5. Utilized UML class diagrams and user specifications for effective software development planning and employed JSON for data persistence.
